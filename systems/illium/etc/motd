Illium is a classic garden world, developed to serve as entrepot between
the Terminus Systems and the Asari Republics. To abet this trade, the
normally stringent customs laws of Council space on product safety,
proscribed materials, and sapient trafficking are relaxed. Officially
Illium is not an asari world; it is colonized and operated by asari
corporate interests. This gives it the same legal latitude enjoyed by
the human corporate research enclaves of Noveria.

Illium is one of the youngest asari colonies settled during the 7th
Expansion Wave. The first child born on the world is only now reaching
her middle-age. The world is hot and massive; ground settlement is only
possible at the higher polar latitudes. In more equatorial locations, the
population is housed in arcology skyscrapers to escape the heat of the
surface.
