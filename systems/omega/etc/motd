Built in the mined-out husk of a metallic asteroid, Omega has been a
haven for criminals, terrorists, and malcontents for thousands of years.
At times the station has lain idle and abandoned for centuries, only to
be reactivated by a new group of outlaws seeking a fresh start. The space
station's original elegant design has given way to haphazard expansion by
scrabbling factions of every species. There is no central government or
unifying authority on Omega, and nobody can recall a time there ever was
one.
