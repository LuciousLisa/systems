Formerly a quarian colony, Haestrom was established to observe the
phenomena on Dholen, the system's parent star. Dholen appeared to be
unstable, with a high possibility of erupting prematurely into a red
giant.

Haestrom was lost to the geth in 1896 CE. Soon after, all communication
from the planet and its attendant space stations ceased. The geth have
shown no signs of treating Dholen as a threat over the past three
centuries, other than establishing several space stations near it.
Dholen's magnetic eruptions and solar output overwhelm most
communications near it, and it is unclear how the geth have compensated.

Today spy probe scans indicate extensive orbital construction around
Haestrom, housing thousands of geth platforms and an unknown number of
geth software "minds". It is not known how many geth are on the planet's
surface: Spy probes face interference from Dholen, making remote scanning
difficult. Resource estimates based on geth mining, refining, and
fabricating procedures suggest that the planet has at least 20 more years
of use before it is exhausted. Intelligence experts speculate that the
geth have not exploited all of their resources because they wish to keep
some in reserve for repairs.
